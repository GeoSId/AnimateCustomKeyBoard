# AnimateCustomKeyBoard
Is a unique and interactive Android application that combines a custom keyboard with an engaging animation effect. The core idea is that when a user types a letter on the custom keyboard, that letter "floats" from the keyboard to a designated box at the top of the screen, filling the box.
